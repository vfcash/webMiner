Use emscripten to compile [https://emscripten.org/](https://emscripten.org/)

**Usage advice**; you can embed this miner into your website, hide the output text area from view and use a JS script on a timeout loop to submit the content of the miner output with using AJAX to your local server side script. You can either parse the "Private Key:" outputs on the client JS side or the server side. The compiled miner script ready to use is located in `/bin`.
